# Resume-Screening-using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on building an end-to-end Resume Screening System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to automate the process of analyzing resumes and predicting their job categories, similar to real-world CV screening systems used in HR and recruitment platforms.
🔍 Project Overview

Preprocessed and analyzed a real-world resume dataset

Applied text cleaning, vectorization, and feature extraction

Trained and evaluated multiple supervised ML models

Used visualizations to understand data distribution and model performance

Designed the workflow to resemble an industry-style CV screening project

🧠 Machine Learning Techniques Used

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, normalization)

TF-IDF Vectorization

Multiple classification models (trained and compared)

Model evaluation using accuracy and performance metrics

📊 Visualization & Analysis

Category-wise resume distribution

Model performance comparison

Insightful plots for better interpretability
